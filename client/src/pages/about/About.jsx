              I hold a passion for developing things and believe that great
              things are often invisible. With an impactful thoughts and job,
              you can convey your story or the story of your business to a wider

              I’m a also a person with an entrepreneurial mindset. Due to my
              entrepreneurial mindset, I’m really flexible when it comes to
              achieving certain objectives. Think about developing top-notch
              web(apps) and website, but also there is competiton. When I start
              with a certain task, I do want to know what you’re exactly in need
              of.

              Reason why I spend time in learning more skills is because of the
              fact that it makes me a more valuable person(developer). I am a
              big believer in focus on a specific area and getting really good
              at it.

            <p className="text-lg font-SpaceGrotesk">
              I’ve been involved in trying to get into development since self
              thought and when you decide to learn something it is obvious you
              face difficulties. I would like to thank Sumit Saha (Learn with
              sumit) & Hitesh Choudhary. His javascript (Chai aur javascript)
              and react (Chai aur react) helped me learning most of the things i
              work with now

              I spend most of my time in front of laptop developing and
              learning. Working remotely is that I love, because it saves (a lot
              of) commuting time. However, this does not mean I am unwilling to
              work in other locations.
